Contentful to Neo4j
===================

This library will populate a neo4j database from a contentful space.

Currently I am just spiking the api's required.

So far I can read entries and assets from contentful.

I can now create relationships for images. 

Known issues:

1. Only have 4 of the 5 image relationships
2. Problems adding fields with lots of text.
